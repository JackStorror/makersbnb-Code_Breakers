Users can list multiple spaces.

```
As a user

I need to be able to add more multiple spaces
```
Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.

Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.

```

Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.

```
As a signed up user
So that I can avoid double bookings
users should not be able to request to book on nights already booked.
```
Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.

```
As a user
So that I can choose between booking requests
My space should be available until I've accepted a booking request.
